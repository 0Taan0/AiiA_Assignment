       " '[CLS]dear mr novak i am very grateful for your offer but there some things that i would like to discuss first the directors board your offer of providing  slovenian employees in the board is based on the relations within the european market and not on building the product itself the relations with\\xa0local authorities and local partners can also be sustained  maintained via  representative therefore we have to provide  representatives of hurm ag and  representative form svn tech\\xa0 second the engineers without any doubt we have to send some key engineers as it is also in our interest to push the development of the green spirit engine to be honest usually in this kind of business firms providing technology agree to keep their engineers working for additional  months in foreign plants to get the whole thing started and train the local staff after these  months your people will be able to solve all of the problems themselves\\xa0 we will pay the wages of our own staff and we insist that svn tech will pay for all the slovenian workers workers and staff specially hired for the joint venture could be paid for in equal terms by us and by you\\xa0 i am a bit disappointed in the fact that you want the project completely under the slovanian law it feels like there is a lack of trust so to make clear we do not intend to play tricks or tactical manoeuvres during our cooperation but we need some sort of legal security especially because there is evidence that foreign companies face really big problems to demand slovenian rights to prevent this it is important that the project will be conducted under our law\\xa0 the technological knowhow is our key for essential first mover advantage in the future market of the engine industry we can by no means afford to lose this knowledge to a competitor as the workers in the production chain are the most important we suggest a additional compensation of \\xa0 i am looking forward to hearing from you soon yours sincerely mr mendel \\xa0 [SEP]',\n",

       " '[CLS]dear mr mendel thank you for getting back to me so soon i really have to admit that i am enjoying our negotiation so far i found the time to go through your second counteroffer this morning and i think we can already see that we already are on the same page with the majority of the issues nevertheless there are still some small points i want to address and one point where i would like to ask you for some further clarification as far as the distribution of the seats in the board and the payment of our common workers are concerned we would like to accept your current offer i see that the court of jurisdiction\\xa0is a topic where both our companies have strong opinions i definitely agree to your argumentation that having legal topics discussed outside of the domestic legal system can be a vexatious undertaking as you already can imagine our company has made the same experiences facing legal demands of foreign companies therefore please let me be the first to propose a compromise to this issue we would like to hear your opinion on going for a solution with independent arbitrators in that matter hurm ag and svn tech could both incorporate the topics that are the most crucial to them while having a neutral third party acting as a mediator additionally the effort to coordinate patent issues etc with foreign and domestic administrations could be outsourced to the arbitrators to a great extent keeping in mind that both our companies did not want to give in on this topic i suggest this solution to be the best way to cope with that issue for the remaining two issues i would like to ask you to further clarify your second counteroffer regarding the period of the engineers staying in slovenia as you wrote in your mail you suggest a period of  months in the data sent with your mail you entered a value of  months therefore i want to propose two options that would be equally feasible for svn tech and would also represent a deal i think both parties can be more than happy with in the two cases the two remaining issues of our negotiation – the period of the engineers in slovenia and the additional compensation of the svn employees – will be addressed option  on the argumentation of your last offer i can agree to the fact that staying abroad for work can be not only an experience but is sometimes also combined with small downsides therefore in that option we would like to agree to an additional stay of the engineers for additional  monthsin this case the remaining onsite implementation phase would require further resources from svn tech side as we already agreed to an additional compensation of our workers of  we could not deviate from that value any further the compensation in this case would already be half way through to what you expect compared to our plans to leave out an additional compensation of our negotiation option  current offerthis option involves a proposal forming the counterpart to option  and is the option that was entered in the system by me for this offer please note that we would be happy to agree to both of the options and the current choice has no deeper meaning this option is based on the notion that you are willing to agree to a period of additional \\xa0months of the engineers staying in slovenia as mentioned in my previous argumentations this would ensure a smooth implementation process onsite without further need for additional resources from svn tech in that matter to compensate this we would be willing to increase the additional compensation of our employees to the \\xa0you suggested please understand that the differences in the compensation might seem small to a swiss company with a higher salarylevel but they are quite a big financial burden even for a wellsituated company like ours still to balance this option out we would agree to take on this investment please take all the time you need to tradeoff the options i composed within this offer and let me know your thoughts on them i am looking forward to hear from you kind regards ms novak [SEP]',\n",

       " '[CLS]dear mr mendel first of all thank you very much for your quick reply we are also very happy to work with a commited and competent partner furthermore it is nice to hear about your positive experiences and after the first exchange i am sure to gain this time some positive experiences too especially regarding our common project goals we are also looking forward to bring this project to a success for both parties and that is why we have to discuss some issues offered by you  as the compensation for all slowenian workers is in the interest of both parties and one of the most important issues for us we would like to stay at the   additional compensation normally these are highly secret internal matters and our management is not prepared discussing it with external partner but we would like to get to an consensus and already took with those   some steps towards you we are in line with your statement that wellpaid employees are less induced to be bribed or to leave the firm and have to emphasize that our employees already enjoy very good working conditions and our salaries are far above the average in eastern europe moreover to get in line with you in order to keep our workstaff motivated and to keep the necessary knowhow within the joint venture we propose that a ten percent additional compensation is a good solution for both our employees and us furthermore by building a joint venture to produce new technologybased engines and beeing a pioneer in this market we are well prepared for the future of the car industry which implies a high job security for our workers i guess that our workers will be more than satisfied to get a salary increase and a job guarantee too which means a lot to a worker in an eastern european country we will promise you that our workers will be more than motivated and satisfied with this solution can you get in line with our proposal and how do you think about it regarding the second point thank you very much for your explanation and you concession to split the costs unfortunately we have to face a high cost increase with the  additional compensation of all slowenian workers which makes it even harder to compensate also the payment of the common workers we highly unterstand the inefficent administrative effort but we guess that in comparison to our costs it wont be that expensive for you to pay the common workers furthermore our workers are far more cheaper than your workstaff which which would not lead to high cost increase for you what do you think about this suggestion but if there is no room for further concessions from your side we would also agree to a split of the costs of the common workers as you have made some concessions we are sure that this third point would be in you favour and will surely convice you if you are ready to accept our above mentioned proposals we would be ready to make a huge concession towards you we would give you the legel component and accept that the court of jurisdiction will be in switzerland as it is a very important subject for you and outstandingly important for this cooperation we are ready to make this huge concession for us it is also a very important issue because the joint venture will set up on slovenia with a slovenian partner and slowenian people so normally it would be an obvious solution that this project will be conducted under slowenian law because we have a lot of experience with the slowenian buracracy and know which steps we have to take into account moreover it would be also the faster solution because of some lanuage contraints which are likely to occur additionally an implementation of arbitrators is out of question for us because this would lead just to additional costs for both sides which can be saved and with this step towards you we would like to emphasize that we trust you rely on you and give you the legal security that you need in order to build a stronger relationship for the future  what is your perspective on this matter and the first issues discussed we are looking forwards to get your confirmation for some of the points before negotiation about the last issues thank your in advance and we are looking forward for your answer best regards mrs novak [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]dear mrs novak\\xa0 thank you for contacting me again i will briefly respond to your proposals first of all thank you for your amazing gesture since switzerland has the best court of jurisdiction we believe that this choice the best option for both parties since we see that you made a huge concession we are willing to to the same regarding next issues the common workers and the additional compensation\\xa0 firstly the subject of the common workers unfortunately we are afraid that with splitting the costs we already have to make a consession towards you there is no room for further concessions since this really is bad for our administrative department thereby we also need to pay our own workers and therefore we do not have the means to pay for the common workers as well because we understand that your own workers loans are pretty expensive we believe that splitting the costs is the best solution for both parties and to reach our common goal the launch and success of the green spirit therefore it would be really nice if you are willing to split the costs\\xa0 secondly the additional compensation for the workers is one of the most important issues for us as well i think it is positive that we are both so engaged in this general goal we agree with your statement that being a pioneer in this market is beneficial for job security however because technological knowhow is our key for the essential first mover advantage in the future market of the engine industry we can by no means afford to lose this knowlegde to a competitor hence we believe in high additional compansation since you have made a concession on the previous issue we are willing to make a concession as well and go for fifteen percent if this is not an option we are still willing to look at your previous proposal of ten percent however it would be a huge concession for us as well how do you feel about this issue we hope to hear from you soon kind regards mr mendel \\xa0 \\xa0 [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]dear mr mendel thank you very much for your response and the concessions you made i’m happy to see that we are both interested in the other sides’ interests and strive for an overall outcome maximization furthermore we would like to emphasize that in our opinion it is not really the best option to choose as court of jurisdiction the switzerland but we understand that this point is one of the most important for you and that you need some legal security as our partnership is still very young with this concession we would like to build trust in us and our young and hopefully long relationship together  firstly it’s very positive to see that we have the same intention with the additional compensation on one hand we agree with you that we can’t afford to lose our workers to competitors but we can assure you that this won’t be the case because for workers in eastern europe the job security plays a bigger role and with an additional compensation of  they will be more than satisfied because they already know that their salary is far above other companies in our country and they enjoy very good working conditions however if we make a high  compensation we believe that our workers will insist on an even higher compensation in future which will be unaffordable for us on the other hand we believe that extrinsic motivation should not be the only motivation factors to work in our company they should be also intrinsic motivated to work for a big company and with the introduction of the zero emission engine “green spirit” we are going to achieve this motivation and as we have to shoulder the main burdens in financial terms as well as in human resources we can’t afford a higher compensation than  so in this point we can’t make a greater concession that these  secondly as you mentioned before the technological knowhow is our key for the essential first mover advantage in the future market and therefore we need your technological experience in this case to be able to ensure this knowhow and to educate our workers being able to produce high quality engines we need your engineers to stay here for additional  months so we highly agree with you that the knowhow is necessary but as it is a completely new technology and our employees aren’t sufficiently qualified for this technology we need your engineers to stay here for  months for a professional development of our workers moreover you have enough experience in the car industry to know that high quality engines are quite necessary in this market and little mistakes could have high negative impacts as we will implement a completely new technology to ensure that this scenario won’t happen we need a longer introduction because we experienced that a longer introduction phase in the beginning will lead to fewer mistakes at the end i hope you can agree with us because we know that for new products the customers’ acceptance is very necessary and in order to get their acceptance we can’t afford any mistakes so what do you think on this issue are you in line with our opinion on this point  what is your opinion on the numbers of board members you want to have maybe we can find a better overall solution for the payment of the common workers if we take this issue into account we are looking forward to hear your opinion on these issues kind regards mrs novak [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]dear mrs novak\\xa0 thank you for your quick reply once again so far i am glad with our way of communicating as well since i truly believe that you care for both interests and want to reach a positive outcome for both parties\\xa0 first we understand your issues concerning the additional compensation of slovenian workers because this is a really important issue for you we are willing to settle and go for the ten percent compensation of slovenian workers however we would like to emphasize as well that in we believe a higher additional compensation of slovenian workers is still the best solution with this consession we want to show to you and svn tech that we are willing to make some consessions and we are determined to make this coorperation work secondly without any doubt we have to send some key engineers as it is also in our interest to push the development of the green spirit engine however it would be best for us to bring them back as soon as development has finished this is because we need the engineers back in switzerland since the development there completely stops and this is not beneficial for the development of the green spirit therefore additional twelve months is unfortunately not possible however we understand that this subject is important to you as well as to our overall goal furthermore as already mentioned we want to build a sustainable relationship with you and therefore we are willing to make a another concession and send the engineers for six months in our experience with this business firms providing technology keep their engineers working for additional six months in foreign plats to get the whole thing started and to train the local staff therefore we consider six months as a sufficient amount of time we hope you are willing to settle for this option because i am afraid it would be a disaster if the engineers are away for a longer period of time\\xa0 thirdly we already agreed with svn tech on having  members on the board altogether since hurm ag created green spirit we believe that the best oppurtunity for the green spirit is if all the members are from hurm ag since the previous concessions we made we hope that you see the importance of this matter for us and are willing to do some consessions on your behalf what is your view on this matter\\xa0 kind regards\\xa0 finn mendel \\xa0 [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]dear mr mendel thank you very much for your complete counteroffer im glad to see that we are in line with each other to the most points and expect to come to an agreement as soon as possible first of all it is very positive that we are both commited in the development of the green spirit and of course we can understand you that it would be the best for you to get your engineers back as soon as development has finished but in my opinion it is necessary to implement an engine in the market with an error rate of nearly zero and if this step can be guaranteed then we expect to take further development on the green spirit imagine the worst scenario that our green spirit engine failed in the market due to high error rates which is caused by a too fast qualification of our workers and then we both will suffer of these mistakes which we can prevent easily just by enlarging the training time of our workers and this risk is in our position way too high because your company has always the solution to sell your idea of the green spirit to competitors but our company which has to shoulder the biggest part of the costs of our joint venture will not get anything and then we have to struggle with high expenditures without getting any revenues back but getting back to my point we believe that this implementation will not be completely ready in six months we get your point that you are not ready to send your workers for  months otherwise it would end in a disaster for your company but we believe that  months would be too short as it is a very new technology we are not ready to take any high risks and therefore would like to make also a concession and suggest that  months will extremely decline the risk for both of us we cant allow any mistakes in our implementation and only one broken engine will destroy the whole effort both companies put in if it would be an implementation of a quite standard product we would agree your statement that six months are enough to getting started everything but as it is a completely new product and we enter a new market we have to make sure that everything will go right of course  months would be the best solution without any risks for us but we understand also your situation and that you cant relinquish on your workers for such a long period and therefore we would like to propose  months which would be a concession of both sides and enlarge the overall outcome for both what do you think of this suggestion unfortunately your suggestion of five members in the board from hurm ag made us question the entire cooperation we understand that your company created the green spirit but your explanation why it should be five members of your company doesnt sound very logical to us you hurm ag were ready to build this joint venture with us together but i cant see which role we should play in it it seems like you want us to produce your engines pay higher wages for our workers want as security the jurisdiction of law to be in switzerland but dont want us to have any part in the board which means that we have no voting rights about the future decisions of our common joint venture so does this seems fair to you in this situation we would like to have also some security that not all decisions are made without our opinion and therefore we expect to have at least three members of board which also means that your company has two members of board i hope that you have trust in our joint venture and it would be the best if we would have three members of board because as the production will take place in slowenia it is much easier for a slowenian firm to to work with local authorities and local partners than for a foreign firm if you would have the majority i fear that we would just suffer from the alien status as these authorities exert considerable influence on our cooperation it would be the solution and obviously the most advantageous for hurm ag to commit the exercise of communication with them to us as you see we know that this issue is important for you and we want just the best for our joint venture and we see more advantages than disadvantages if we would have the majority of board and because your opinion and your votes are also very important to us we want you to take also place in the board with two members what do you think about this issue hope to hear from you soon kind regards sasa novak [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]dear mrs novak\\xa0 thank you for your response\\xa0 first of all thank you for your opinion on the engineers matter i am glad to hear that you are so dedicated to the implemantation of the green spirit we understand your worries regarding this implementation however we can assure you that  months is a sufficient amount of time to completely reduce the risks of an implementation error as well as other errors as i mentioned before we are very experienced with these type of issues so we know that  months is simpy not neccessary and would be detrimental for both parties as well as the green spirit because we need the engineers to work on further developments if you trust us in this matter we can assure you that this wont be harmful for the green spirit or svn tech if it would be we wouldnt even consider it as an option since we want to make it a success\\xa0 secondly we are sorry if our last offer made you think that we feel like we do not want to work with you because that is not the case at all however what you are stating it seems like you want us to produce your engines pay higher wages for our workers common joint venture is not correct we have already made a lot of concessions on our behalf on almost all the negotiationable issues also the ones that are really important to us therefore we show that we are willing to let this cooperation succeed and we can be trusted we feel like you are saying again and again that you want to make this cooperation work but your action say otherwise\\xa0overall we made some huge consessions on almost every negotiationable issue in your last offer we do not believe to see the same cooperation on your side if we have to overcompensate on the last two issues it will be neccessary to look at the previous discussed issues before since the overall costs for hurm ag would be to big it would be a pity to look at those again since we came to an agreement on those issues already we believe that a good cooperation is all about the willingness to split the costs and to keep in mind the overall goal we are looking forward to hear your opinion kinds regards finn mendel [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]dear mr mendel thank you very much for your message it would be definitely a pity to renegotiate these issues again maybe we can find a better solution furthermore it is quite necessary to split the overall costs in order reaching higher outcomes for both parties but at the current offer we would like to emphasize that the svn tech has to shoulder the most costs we have to bring in the most assets like the production site here in slovenia the human capital the additional compensation and the only issue we splitted the costs is for the common workers so i guess that we have to bear the higher costs but we are ready to make this concession if we can agree on the following counteroffer we hope that it is not the case at all that you dont want to work with us because we really want to work with you and want this cooperation to be as fruitful as possible for both of us furthermore we would like to apologize if we insulted you with our hard description of the assets we brought in until now but after your proposal that all board members should be of hurm ag we felt very exploited another point is that almost both parties made really huge concessions towards the other party it is not the case that only you have made concessions we made also huge concessions on each issue which is not the best outcome for us but we guess it will be the best outcome for our joint venture and this is of more interest than our own position in our latest offer we would like to propose a compromise and hope that both sides are commited for it because both issues are important for us but for you too in this case we would be ready to make a concession and accept that four members of board would be from hurm ag but as an point we definitely need the additional  months as security issue we think that this would be the best solution in order to get an agreement we still believe that a higher number of members in the board on behalf of us would be the better solution because the production will take place in slowenia and the slowenian authorities could be very hard with three members you already would have the majority which means that you the hurm ag can make decisions without any of our votes but we would like to build the trust to you and therefore give you four seats of the board and want in contrast some security from your side we need the security that the implementation will be good enough to reduce the errors to zero because we experienced from other cooperations and partners that six months are as fruitful as no implementation and at the end we needed more than a year to overhaul the mistakes we understand your situation that you need your engineers for development but we need them too for the implemetion and in order to prevent any mistakes we need a larger implementation phase another arugument is that our workers may not have the same intellectual skill as your worker and even more not the same language skills in our opinion to minimize the risks to launch the green spirit with zero mistakes and gain the maximum of the first mover advantage we need your engineers for another three months what do you think about this issue we would be glad if you would accept this offer because with the members on board we made a huge concession and with the nine months we alredy made a concessions towards this issue too and hope that you could take some steps towards us and grant us your engineers for furher three months kind regards mrs novak [SEP]',\n",

       " '[CLS]dear mr mendel thank you for your detailed reply i really appreciate your fast feedback i have a good feeling that we will be able to conduct these negotiations with an outcome fitting both of our expectations therefore please see some background information below also giving some feedback to the points you have stated hurm directors in board\\xa0svn is fully commited to the range of  directors in the board and we are happy to see that the hurm ag also wants to rely on this agreement we appreciate your offer to communicate transparently and to get some advices from svn but we would like to focus on our cooperation as cooperation is also necessary in the board of management it is essential that we as svn also receive seats in the board as the production will take place in slovenia we recommend having  seats representing svn tech especially since most of the employees included in the joint venture will be in responsibility of svn we need those workers to build trust to the board of management driving their company which will be way easier if the majority of seats is represented by svn directors the input of hurm ag in the board of management is essential for us therefore the rest of the seats definitely has to be in charge of hurm ag members to further develop our cooperation starting in the board of management and inducing the cooperation through the whole organisation\\xa0 engineers in slovenia\\xa0\\xa0we as svn appreciate the commitment that engineers of hurm ag will be on site while the production is ramping up as you would know from former ramp ups many problems can occur in the first  months of production of course this includes the first pieces falling out of our production lines but especially during the   months a trustful and reliable cooperation on site is necessary from our point of view but we as svn can understand the point that you do not want your engineers to work abroad for that long therefore we propose a compromise in the middle of our two initial offers proposing a  month stay abroad which should be benefitial for both of us\\xa0 payment of common workers\\xa0 additional compensation of slovenian workers\\xa0  we understand that the necessarity of additional common workers is not mandatory and can not be estimated completely nevertheless we should handle this issue as well during this settlement there is nothing leading to more arguments in a cooperation than uncleared issues we dont want our cooperation to be exposed to that risk concerning the additional compensation of slovenian workers we are in contradiction to our general internal guidelines ready to discuss the issue with our cooperation partner as this seems to be very important to you we are happy to share with you the information that svn already is paying higher salaries than other companies in average in eastern europe this is the reason how svn ensures its employees to work on long time contracts in our plants leading to happy and satisfied employees and a good working clima we understand that the swiss salary level is way higher than the slovenian therefore we would like to propose the following svn is ready to pay the salary of the commonly hired workers in reverse conclusion we request that these additional costs for svn will be subtracted from the additional compensation of slovenian workers leading to a  increase of slovenian workers salary this combination should be more than sufficient for you and we think that this offer will fit your expectations please be ensured that recalculation of the business case has been reviewed with several combinations and we can assure that other combinations can not be accepted by svn we recommend this bundle to be accepted by hurm ag\\xa0 court of jurisdiction\\xa0 we understand the point that slovenian law on the first look is not an easy issue to settle but we think that there are two points which lead our preference on this issue to the slovenian jurisdiction on the one hand the location of our plant is the key to this as our suppliers will deliver their products to slovenia slovenian law automatically is valid the same apparently applying for our customers for eg customer claims furthermore as we are ready to pay the commonly hired workers those workers will be automatically as you mentioned working and living on slovenian law this leads to the assumption that slovenian law will be responsible especially concerning social jurisdiction therefore we can not exclude the slovenian law anyway in order to prevent additional costs for both of us while consulting independent arbitrators we propose to settle on the slovenian jurisdiction\\xa0 i hope that the points above fit your expectations and i hope that hurm ag accepts our trustful offer i am looking forward to your reply\\xa0 best regards from slovenia sasa novak [SEP]',\n",

       " '[CLS]dear mr mendel at the same beginning we would like to thank you very much for the fast response and for giving us all information we requested i am strongly convinced that our joint venture should be based on honesty it will fasten our negotiations and help us to achieve desired target turning these words into action we want to inform you that all our negotiation team and management is deeply shocked with the given propositions however we can calmly understand you it was the first offer and we did not introduce you our statement to be able to understand each other i spent many hours to know better the history of both companies analyse the most important decisions and to find some similarities as we know hurm ag has a long experience in automotive industry beginnings were very though but after  years thanks to the international help business started to develop quickly all has dramatically changed after ecofriendly paris agreement was ratified by the most countries massive fuelconsuming engines could not compete with hybrid or fully electric engines it made your company to fire over  workers and to close many plants now hurm ag is in serious financial troubles and the only hope is the last engineering project “green spirit” however peter o’brien who is responsible for international affairs in your company has informed us in the first letter that you are not able to produce them nonetheless one of the best consulting company has chosen svn tech as the most suitable option to solve your problem our firm located in slovenia is fastdeveloping manufacturer wellknown of its advanced technology local government has announced huge investments in infrastructure what will trigger rapid inflow of foreign entrepreneurs independent economists are convinced that the best period to bring capital to liubljana is now we are receiving many lucrative offers from the biggest players in the market to produce their hybrid engines now we would like to introduce you our statement which will be the most appropriate also for you we are going to explain our decisions in detail under each presented offer \\xa0  hurms directors in board our offer  directors who are responsible for operational issues must know how to cooperate with the local firms and all the aspects of the local market slovenian community is quite conservative and usually do not trust strangers it will be much harder for the foreign directors eg to persuade suppliers to the lower prices or to make decisions faster we are better oriented in rules of the slovenian society what help us to achieve better financial results however we understand hurm’s needs to train managers that is why we invite two of them to our team  time hurms engineers stay in slovenia our offer additional  months afterwards we have to deal with the issue how long hurm’s engineers will stay after the finished researches as we all know most of the defects with newly invented engines come out after the first half a year taking this into account your offer of  months is disrespectful and offensive for us\\xa0we cannot build our joint venture in these conditions\\xa0for the proper development of “green spirit” your engineers who are responsible for this project must stay at least  months after this period major problems should be solved we do not see any reasons why your engineers should stay longer because our staff can implement basic amendments however by way of exception we are able to agree for that  payment of swiss workers our offer hurm ag crucial feature of joint venture are assets brought by two companies svn tech already take the major burden of human resources moreover our company is responsible for factories machines taxes public relations administration etc we have been in engine industry for  years your company for  years hurm ag had to struggle with financial problems for first four decades you should understand that we also have additional expenses we are hardly able to pay our employees svn tech cannot afford to pay your workers in slovenia swiss salaries which are many times higher than ours  additional compensation for slovenian workers our offer  next step relates to the previous one according to joint venture policy of transparency we want to reveal that this issue is the most important for svn tech as we mentioned before our budget is very tight our company must struggle with many expenses for the development and repayment of loan instalments we can ensure you that we provide excellent working conditions and salaries far above the average in eastern europe we are not willing to pay any additional compensation for our workers however taking our future cooperation into account we are able to make concessions in this most important issue for us we hope that you will appreciate this gesture with the great effort from our side we can offer  pay rise one the one hand it will tear our budget but on the other we are aware that you want to avoid international scandal this  compensation will be certainly sufficient \\xa0  court of jurisdiction our offer independent arbitrators the last part of our negotiations is the legal component in the first meeting hurm ag insisted on setting up a joint venture in slovenia with fully slovenian company the whole process of designing and producing engines will be conducted under slovenian law we totally do not understand your lack of trust to our country since many years we are part of european union what means that the whole law is compatible and almost the same as in the other members svn tech considers that the best solution for both sides will be jurisdiction of slovenian court it will allow our joint venture to save a lot of money and make decisions much faster \\xa0however as in the previous point we would like to reach a compromise with hurm ag that is why we can agree to implementation of a team of arbitrators  at the end we want to explain why we are so strongly convinced to our offer and why it is so attractive for you svn tech is quite young fastdeveloping company with the great perspectives to the future and excellent opinion even if we don’t sign this contract we will exist well in the market for long years we are producing reliable motorcycles and the government wants to invest a lot of money to support our enterprise moreover economists expect rapid growth of slovenia’s gdp in the next years what means we will experience meaningful progress too it is not a coincidence that the consulting company has chosen us as the best potential partner for your further development in contrast hurm ag is strongly threaten by bankruptcy many workers were fired and many plants were closed you cannot afford to produce engines in your place because you are out of money and you do not have enough space to do it we all know that costs of business in switzerland are many times higher than in slovenia it is true that you can sell idea of “green spirit” to the other company but this money will finish very quickly and you will lose the last opportunity to keep your firm in the market we have had bad experience with foreign partners so far they were focused only on their goals not on the joint goals this joint venture is highly risky to us we will have to cover all costs of producing “green spirit” and we cannot be even sure that your company won’t go bankrupt both of our comapanies are aware that the key of success is acceptance of our common product by customers unfortunately it takes sometimes a lot

       " '[CLS]dear mr mendel i hope you enjoyed a nice weekend i am sasa novak in the next round of negotiation i will communicate with you on behalf of svn tech i heard that you are a professional negotiator and hope we can afford to be frank and honest with one another and cooperate happily \\xa0 after the first round of discussions we have already reached a consensus that we can benefit a lot by collaborating with each other and in the following negotiation we are going into detail to solve the open issues for the number of directors we want to have  members of this board to represent svn tech the reason why we should take the majority in the board of directors is that it is much easier for a slovenian firm to work with local authorities and local partners than for a foreign firm who may suffer from its alien status this proposal only aims to better deal with local business usually the engineers in common plants are supposed to stay for another  months after the main development of a technology has been finished considering the high cost of dispatched personnel we propose that you can keep your engineers only for another  months the payment\\xa0of commonly hired employees we have already talked about in the last round of negotiations\\xa0 we still take the position that hurm ag should bear these costs because we already take the majority of the\\xa0burden of the human resources eg the staff from the administrative department production department and logistics support etc invested in this project i hope as a unit we can share happiness and hardship we know you also want to discuss the additional compensation of slovenian workers hurm ag is a wellknown company who has a\\xa0good reputation and significant influence we do not want any negative things that may ruin the reputation of harm ag regarding the working conditions of our employees an additional compensation of  is sufficient to prevent any scandals this is a reasonable percentage for both of us for the choice of a court of jurisdiction we know you have little concerns about slovenian law system because you are not familiar with it and intend to choose independent arbitrators however it brings huge additional costs for both of us since the joint venture was set up in slovenian the court of jurisdiction from slovenia would be a better choice for us i hope we can build trust considering the great intention of further cooperation \\xa0 of course i would like to know more about your opinions if you are willing to share your information and i believe there must be a better agreement if we communicate well with each other the summary of the open issues are as following if you have any other questions please feel free to contact me \\xa0 best regards  sasa novak [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]dear miss novak my weekend was fine thank you i also hope that this collaboration can benefit from both parties and that our negotiation won’t take too long to come to an agreement i read your proposal but i have a few remarks on your suggestions  first you mentioned the number of board directors i can see your point that you want four members in the board from svn tech but hurm ag cannot agree with this we wanted to suggest that hurm ag provides all members and svn tech provides no members but since this might be a little optimistic i suggest hurm ag provides four members and svn tech one member of the board since hurm ag is the one whose ideas will be brought in to action i strongly suggest that we provide at least four members if you provide one member there will still be enough room for contact with local businesses and they can advise the other board members on local opportunities  for the engineers in common plants hurm ag wants to let our engineers stay till\\xa0the development is finished in that period of time they can start the whole thing off and train the local staff optimally we have worked with foreign businesses in eastern europe in the past and looking at our experiences over there the time given for the development was more than enough the first period can be used to start the whole thing off the last couple of months can be used to train the engineers with individual care therefore we think there is no need to keep our engineers longer than necessary since we also need our employees in our factories in switzerland and the engineers from slovenia can stay in touch via skype and email with the swiss engineers if there are questions regarding the project\\xa0  the payment of commonly hired employees is something we indeed discussed in the previous meetings hurm ag is not going to pay for all the costs i wanted to suggest svn tech pays for all common employees but i can understand that this might be a little optimistic therefore i want to meet you halfway and suggest we split the costs we can see that you are taking a lot of human resource costs so i strongly suggest we divide the costs i suggest hurm ag pays for our own employees svn tech pays for their own employees and for the joint venture employees i suggest we divide the costs since these employees are important for the both of us in this case we can’t get any trouble about payments  an additional compensation of the local workers is always something that needs to be done well in order to remain a good reputation i think the  you are suggesting is still a bit low we were thinking about  i can hear you think that’s a bit high but things will pay off by adding that  corruption is something that neither of us want and with that  corruption will stay low both our reputations stay good or might even increase and when the sales increase in the future hurm ag might consider expanding the workload and therefore increase the profit for svn tech i think this is a really good option that you might want to consider  finally the court of jurisdiction we believe that our court system in switzerland is one of the best they offer really good tax rates compared to the slovenian rates and is political \\xa0and economically stable which we find very important therefore we suggest to use the swiss jurisdiction in the past we worked with foreign jurisdictions from other eastern european countries and this backfired hugely for hurm ag and if you agree with the split costs for payments of employees point  we certainly want swiss jurisdiction because of the good conditions for employees of ag firms in switzerland\\xa0 i believe open communication is key for us to come to an agreement i hope you can understand my point of view i am looking forward to your answer\\xa0 \\xa0 kind regards finn mendel [SEP]',\n",

       " '[CLS]dear mr mendel i can tell your difficulties and concerns when you make decisions according to the past experiences and also i can see the effort you made to reach a consensus with us you intended to lower your board members to  but actually  or  members from hurm ag has no difference for us because the majority of the members are yours and simple majority power will decide on all issues later nonetheless for this open issue we have already make a concession we can make a compromise to accept the proposal keeping  or  members from hurm ag in the board this is the sincerity we showed to cooperate with hurm ag about the engineers i think we may have some misunderstandings with each other i know letting all the engineers stay in foreign plants might be too optimistic actually it is also unnecessary my suggestion is that hurt ag keep  engineers in slovenia for another  months the rest of them can go back to switzerland  there is no doubt that your engineers are trained professionals who can explain everything very well in a short time but the problem is our engineers cannot reach that high level to settle down all the technical problems well especially the emergent ones and compared with the cost of travel expense the cost of keeping several engineers stay is relatively low  you also mentioned that the green spirit project is one that needs to be adjusted continuously therefore the engineers who stay in the plants can collecting more detailed information for modification i know you would like to take the risk that is also one of the reasons that we want to cooperate with hurm ag the responsibility but i need to point out these risks can be avoided if we follow the suggestion above taking the risks is not a good way if hurm ag has one problem which is not handled properly both of us may lose the confidence of the market or even have more complex matters to deal with because green spirit is a totally new product for the whole market in the current situation we both need to make little concessions to avoid a deadlock in our negotiations what if we accept the  members to the board of directors as we set before to a more acceptable level for you if you agree you can keep  engineers in slovenia for another  months to a more acceptable situation for us the potential risks may be a huge disaster for both of us also i am sorry for your previous unpleasant collaboration with a foreign company but i hope you can trust us this kind of similar things will never happen in our cooperation as i wrote in the last email that our employees have pretty good working conditions because our salaries are above the average in eastern europe our employees are very loyal and care about our corporate image and reputation and for the protection of intellectual property we also have our own institutional systems therefore  of the additional compensation is enough the higher percentage cannot bring a salient outcome you are a rational decision maker you must know what is decreasing marginal utility this cost from hurm ag is unnecessary as you said in the last email the swiss jurisdiction is better for hurm ag because some of your engineers are working in our common plants and you want to protect the rights of the new invention i can totally understand your point of view but it seems that you overlooked an important thing hurm ag wants to set up a joint venture in slovenia with a slovenian partner that means the project will be conducted under slovenian law invisibly because from raw material procurement to the production of new products all steps are in slovenia and when we are working with local authorities and local partners we also follow the slovenian law i hope you can stand on our position and try to to consider the troubles we will meet  regarding the situation that both of us has our own worries probably we both should make a concession and meet each other halfway for the court of jurisdiction i suggest to choose independent arbitrators if you accept this proposal i will also accept your suggestion for the payment of commonly hired workers that we spilt the cost sincerely i hope we can establish relationships of mutual understanding and cooperation and generate empathy  \\xa0 best regards sasa novak [SEP]',\n",

setting up our new partnership i should send greetings from my boss and superior mr kos to you he told me that you both already had contact when mr kos was working for a different company he explained me that you both had a really good negotiation in which your firm and the one of my boss could find an agreement which provided a winwin situation for both parties moreover i have heard from other colleagues that your former projects were very successful i hope that our negotiations are also a complete success and that we both can present a good result to our bosses furthermore i want to use this chance to introduction myself my name is sasa novak i am working at svn tech since the independence of slovenia – this year i have my  anniversary at the firm as a person i stick to my believes i am a reliable and competent person and i am especially focus on the needs of my business partners because of that a lot of our customers are most satisfied with the technology they use from us my character traits are also reflected in our company mission – svn tech is a reliable and strong partner although we are not that long established at the market one of our strength is that we are very adaptive to new situation and that we have a quick decisionmaking process in addition to this slovenia is an ambitious country our government is investing a lot in our infrastructure in recent times our roads ports and airports getting better and better that as a result our shipments all over the world are more reliable and quicker our connection to the mediterrean sea is an enormous advantage but now to our negotiation i think we both were briefed by our bosses that the first steps in the negotiations were made the first general points of the cooperation were discussed and accepted by both parts now five issues have to be negotiated by us two my boss set me a deadline that all issues have to be discussed and solved until friday on the right side of the message box i submitted a proposal for the issues of the contract that are not discussed yet i would like to explain how our offer originated additional compensation of slovenian workers we know that your company was involved in a scandal regarding working conditions of your employees we totally understand your point of view that you want to ensure that our workers are paid sufficiently so that a scandal like this never happens again due to the fact that we really want to form a joint venture with you we decided to talk about this topic with you normally we only discuss those topics internally we can completely ensure you that we pay our employees more than the average salary paid in eastern europe furthermore we are paying a better salary than our competitors with us as a partner you do not have to be afraid that your reputation suffers if you want to have a review of the actual salary we pay you could also have a closer look in our accountsin our understanding we believe that our workers don’t need an additional compensation court of jurisdiction we believe that the court of jurisdiction should be in slovenia hence the joint venture is located here moreover i would like to tell you that the development in slovenia´s judicature is very impressive our courts are independent and since our membership in the eu we have to prove this to the institutions of eu annually moreover the implementation of a team of arbitrators would be very expensive for both of us we hope that you can understand our argumentation payment of common workers mr mendel in matters of the salary of the common hired workers we rely on you we believe that your firm should pay for those employees completely i hope you and your firm understands that we are investing the mayor part of human resources in this project already due to the fact that both parties should bring assets in the project it would be in the interest of all if you pay for those employees engineers in slovenia we have to admit that we do not have the expertise in the technical terms than your engineers have because of that we rely on a longer stay of your engineers also when the development of the new technology is already finished we would like propose to you that your engineers stay for additional  months mr mendel you work long enough in this business due to this you know that in the beginning of production often problems arise if your engineers are onsite the problems can quickly be eliminated and the production does not have to be stopped as a result no revenue losses for both of us occur board of directors  like our bosses already decided the board of directors should embrace five members we would like to staff  seats in this committee and i would like explain why it is very important that the majority of the board comes from the slovenian firm we will have a lot of contact with local authorities and partners where it will be important to understand the local concerns and solve them quick both of us do not want to lose time time is money and we both want to make money with our joint venture let svn tech carry out the communication with the stakeholders especially in slovenia and you can fully concentrate on the development of

       " '[CLS]dear ms novak what a pleasure to work with you maria alpha who is the head of the team that conducted the first round of discussions with you already told me that the previous negotiation was a very pleasant experience she also told me that you are a team player and very cooperative so i agree with you that we will have a pleasant honest and especially cooperative negotiation\\xa0 since we want to respect the interests of both parties i suggest to exchange what the most important issues are for each other eg the  most important issues we probably have different preferences for different issues when we exchange this information it will allow us to create the most prefered outcomes for our highpriority issues this will result in everyone getting more and the joint outcome will be higher what do you think of this idea if you agree on this you can mention this in you next mailing\\xa0 ive read your recommendations from your side and i want to compliment you for the good foundation however with the goal of respecting both interests and reaching a joint venture i want to make some adjustments regarding the\\xa0number of directors you suggested having  managers of svn tech in the board because it is easier for a slovenian firm to work with local authorities and local partners however since hurm ag has a very good reputation we think that managers of hurm ag would be good to have in the board another reason to have hurm ag managers on board is because they are already familiar with the development of the green spirit engine because they are more familiar this could result in a more critical attitude and higher performance\\xa0yet it is as you stated very important to have also managers of svn tech on the board we think that  manager of svn tech would be enough to communicate with local partners especially because our market not only focuses on slovenia however since we expect to grow in the long term  managers of svn tech would be better than  therefore we suggest  managers of hurm ag and  of svn tech in order to get the most out of our joint venture\\xa0 the next issue that you discussed is the\\xa0additional compensation for slovenian workers i agree that the employees should work under good conditions however an additional compensation of  will be too low out of experience we know that employees easily leave a firm when they get a better payment at another firm since we expect that we will generate good revenue in the long term other competitors really would like to know our inside information this could result in companies offering employees better additional compensations and employees leaving the firm the changes are then high that they reveal inside information to the competitor we can by no case lose this knowledge to a competitor as this would mean to rund risk of bankruptcy for our joint venture therefore we suggest to take no risk and give the employees an additional compensation of  this sounds quite a lot but since we will generate great revenue in the longterm the costs will ultimately be less then the benefits for our joint venture you suggested that the\\xa0engineers should stay in slovenia for  months however we already have a protocols in place that suggests that it would take  months to get the whole thing started and include how to train the local staff i agree with you that having our engineers after this  months is smart to react immediately onsite if problems occur therefore we suggest to stay one more extra month so  months in total if there will occur other problems in the upcoming months we can also fix this immediately because we have bought a very good working videocommunication program this will allows us to be with you if there is a problem\\xa0 looking at the\\xa0court of jurisdiction it is very important for us to rely on swiss court there is evidence that the company of hurm ag will loose their rights when our joint venture relies on slovenian foreign jurisdiction this could result in more problems more expenditure and less budget for investments it will also make it less easy to let our joint venture to grow as quickly and good as possible

on our good cooperation\\xa0 at last the\\xa0payment of common workers i really appreciate that you are wanting to provide nearly your whole capacity of human resources i also understand the risk for you however since we are a joint venture the risk will be for both svn tech as hurm ag so you do not need to worry that when things go wrong that the risk is only for svn tech when things go wrong what we do not expect we will come with a solution eg sending our own employees to slovenia with this in mind i suggest to pay the common workers halfhalf\\xa0 \\xa0 i really like to read your

       " '[CLS]dear mr sasa novak thank you for your kind and fast response i agree that it is more efficient to negotiate in packages of  issues also because of the time pressure thank you for your response on the first issue additional compensation i am relieved that you also understand my point of view and take my arguments into account of course i understand your arguments as well and that this payment is above the average in my opinion we can agree on a compensation of a  payment i think it is a good compromise lets move on to the next issue the court of jurisdiction i understand that in your opinion slovenia is the best place of jurisdiction but have you thought this through enough i agree that it sound very logical for you to keep the court of jurisdiction in slovenia for svn tech because it is a slovenian company of origin but you have to admit that hurm ag is also an important part of this joint venture and it is a better plan for hurm ag to rely on a swiss courtin my past projects i have had a very negative experience with slovenian jurisdiction as a foreign company we faced really big problems with demanding our rights and i really want to prevent hurm ag but also svn tech from happening again of course we do not intend to play any tricks or tactical manoeuvres during this cooperation but nonetheless we need to come to an agreement on this issue since we both want the complete opposite i suggest to meet each other in the middle and i suggest that we rely on a team of arbitrators this team of arbitrators is specialised on crossnational cooperation and relies on international standards i think this is the best option for both of us i also read your arguments about issue  engineers in slovenia and i would love to give you my point of view i think you are right about the fact that some problems arise after the main development of technology has already been finished i also agree with you that we do not want further delay in production and it is important to solve issues very quickly by our own expert engineers but your demand of staying an additional  months is way to much in my opinion i think a period of an additional  months is more than enough to get the whole thing started train the local staff and solve the problems that arise after finishing developing the main technology i am very curious to hear your opinion towards my proposals and that we can agree upon these issues i hope to hear from you soon \\xa0 kind regards finn mendel [SEP]',\n",

       " '[CLS]dear mr sasa novak i am glad to hear from you and your excitement about the start of our joint venture first of all i want to thank you for your initial draft of the contract nontheless i cannot accept it this way since i do have different views on the issues starting with the number ofhurm directors in board i understand that burocracies in slovenia are not the same as they are in switzerland that is why i was thinking of staffing the entire middle management with local slovenian employees to ensure a smooth operation considering this we would need several managers in the upper management to coordinate the development of our new engine and i would therefore recommend having at least\\xa0\\xa0hurm directors in board talking about engagement of hurm employees in the joint venture we are more than happy to support you with\\xa0engineers in slovenia they are fully responsible for the final development of the green spirit onsite and will do their best to create a futureoriented technology by sending our engineers to slovenia we have a high amount of additional costs travel expenses surcharges etc encouraging us to keep their time abroad as short as possible we have to keep in mind that our engineers have family at home and do not want to seperate them for too long thus we are targeting\\xa0 after research finished\\xa0months your believe that\\xa0payment of common workers\\xa0is fair if we pay for the commonly hired workers is unacceptable for us as you mentioned when beginning a joint venture both companies must bring in equal resources you will supply most of the human resources but you totally forgot about us bringing in the technology without our technology you still would \\xa0be obligated to pay your staff and since you are bringing in human resources we think it is only fair that svn tech\\xa0pays for the common staff and since we are on the issue of staff payment we need to talk about the\\xa0additional compensation of slovenian workers i think it is great that\\xa0all svn tech employees appreciate very good working conditions with salaries well above eastern europe average and you understand my position that hurm is not willing to lose the good reputation nevertheless i can tell you openly and honestly that we do have another concern regarding the additional compensation we fear that an additional  loan would not be enough to prevent workers to be corruptive or to leave the firm which could lead to loss of our technological knowhow since knowhow is key for essential first mover advantages in the future markets of the green spirit engine we cannot afford to lose this knowledge to a competitor as this could risk the existence of the whole joint venture therefore i would value an additional compensation of at least\\xa0 last i want to inform you about our shareholder concers regarding the\\xa0court of jurisdiction since they put a lot of money in our company to fund the development of the new engine they are afraid that the slovenian legislation will not allow us to protect our product as good as swiss legislation does on top one of our main shareholders experienced big problems with another foreign company demanding their rights relying on slovenian jurisdiction which we definetly want to avoid by bringing in the most valuable asset to this joint venture  the engine technology  we think it is understandable that we want to protect this asset as good as possible and therefore plead for the court of jursidiction to be based in\\xa0switzerland i hope my argumentation helps you to understand our position in this joint venture and makes it easier for you to accept our conditions in case of doubts or questions regarding single issues we are more than happy to discuss changes with you since we strive for an agreement both parties benefit in the end i am looking forward to your reactions best wishes from switzerland finn mendel [SEP]',\n",

       " '[CLS]dear mrs novak thank you for contacting us\\xa0 as we are also very interested in a joint partnership i would directly get down to the business by responding to your initial offer common workers additional compensation we consider very important the issue of good reputation sustainability for both of our firms we researched the slovenian market and came to the conclusion that the wages there are way too low in comparison to other countries in which such kind of technologies are developed the low wages could jeopardize our joint success for instance by having employees who could leave at any time and even go to another competitors we simply cannot afford to lose them also because they possess very valuable knowhow and replacing them with sufficiently qualified workforce would be time and resources consuming if we could agree on  of salary incrementation we would be able to prolong the stay of our engineers in slovenia originally we planned to withdraw the whole engineersteam from slovenia after the research will be finished payment of workers we understand the salary gap between our two countries and therefore we agree with you on this point a halfhalf payment is fair enough however if we could reach good agreements in other issues we would be ready to finance the common workers by us alone engineers\\xa0at the moment we are developing also other products than engines and we need our qualified workforce to work on them if we do not manage to stay competitive in our domestic market we can easily lose our good market position and we will not be able to finance our projects also those abroad therefore our proposal is to send our engineers team back to switzerland right after the research phase nevertheless we could eventually prolong they stay in slovenia if we manage to agree on a higher compensation for the common workers directors in board thank you firstly for considering our point too yes the idea of the new engines is basically ours and since the production will take place abroad due to the additional production capabilities your firm possesses we need to have at least some kind of control assurance over the production which can be guaranteed by having ideally  hurm directors in board we understand the power your firm brings by knowing well the market in which we are about to operate but we think we could greatly collaborate also with fewer members of yours in board since their opinions and decision making would be equally important due to better knowledge of the domestic market we would certainly not make any important decisions without any previous consultation with your members\\xa0 jurisdiction we would like to draw your attention towards the fact that we dispose of a team of swiss arbitrators specialized in cross national cooperations with a large experience in similar businesses the team\\xa0relies on international standards and therefore it is advantageous to have them in our court of jurisdiction since they follow standardized rules however if everything goes smoothly we actually will not need any court intervention and since the production of new engines will take place in your country we would need also some kind of legal protection in case something goes wrong which we hope really will not i believe this response gives your more and less an idea in which direction we are thinking we would like to reinforce again how much we are interested in a frutiful partnership with your company there is no doubt that both of our firms can jointly profit from our union with unified forces we are therefore looking forward to hear from you very soon\\xa0 best regards finn mendel \\xa0 \\xa0 [SEP]',\n",

       " '[CLS]hello sasa i will adress the elephant in the room this offer is worse for hurm than your last the additional compensation of slovenian workers and court of jurisdiction issues here are basically win or loose issues for hurm the middle way here is binding me to make high demands for basically everthing else and as weve tried here i do not think we will find a solution this way thus i propose we just split them issue wise i will leave them both open in this offer and you decide which one is more important for you and we go on from there obviously we could also allocate that win to any other issue in fact id be rally happy to trade concessions issue by issue here  this would leave us with only one issue where we have to find a middle way yes the middle way is usually not attractive for hurm   for the case the additional compensation of slovenian workers\\xa0 and the court of jurisdiction are the most important one for both of us i filled in the other issues with values that would make this offer acceptable for hurm regardless of which issue you choose [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]hello finn due to the fact that i leave tomorrow for a business trip i would like we to hurry up and have an agreement tonight so this is my last proposal this is the best that i can do i think its fair for both of us and it is my final proposal i hope we agree and close the deal tonight with kind regards sasa ps i would appreciate if you could answer tonight in order to have an effective aggrement because tomorrow is going to be very difficult for me since my flight dures many hours and i wont be able to answer thank you for your understanding in advance \\xa0 [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]hello sasa im sad to hear that i think we were finally starting to get on a good path here but as it stands now this is still slightly below what i can accept i will tweak that offer a little bit and then you are free to decide how to proceed since you are the one leaving still it has been a pleasure negotiating with you and have a nice flight yours finn \\xa0 [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]hey finn okay thank for your quick response and for the understanding also so i agree with the change of your issue about the hurm directors therefore i think that we can have this agreement thank you for all it was a pleasure for me to work with you i hope to meet you in person in future yours sasa [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]dear finn mendel \\xa0 i am pleased that you agreed on negotiating online mainly because we have time pressure i hope that we will cooperate well and try to understand each other needs i heard that you are a successful man and full of knowledge so i am glad to work with you although it may seem that one week is a lot of time i usually like to conclude my project slightly few minutes before then a few minutes after the deadline i hope that the same stands for you as you are probably informed we have to agree on five issues\\xa0 i am aware that all of those issues are crucial for both of us however i was already thinking about those issues and i found a possible solution\\xa0 i want to present it to you and i also argue all of my choices \\xa0 about the number of directors on board\\xa0 as we already made a general agreement about creating a joint venture and we agreed to set it up in slovenia in my opinion the best solution would be for the future of that company that you have two members on board  the reason for that is because we slovenians have a unique culture and it is much easier for us to communicate with our local authorities and partners we can better understand their thoughts and ideas and in this case also your senses will be well heard this could be in some way connected with our issue about a court of jurisdiction we could both agree that if the work is done in one country and if employees are working here also the court should be here i can tell you that our law system is getting better and you should not have any concerns about that i know that your company is very experienced and that you have a lot of successful projects behind you because of that i think that you know that transferring technology to another location is a complicated process even more complicated are the start and the first year of the operation of the company production line for that reason because we would both like to avoid any further problems i propose that your engineers stay here for the next  months with that we will provide a steady start of the production about paying the »common workers«\\xa0 we already take the majority of the burden of human resources invested in this project so i do not think that there is a need to split the costs we know that we should pay for our workers that mean that you should pay for yours also we should both bring some assets to the joint venture we are already having huge troubles with all the hr problems last but not least we should discuss additional compensation to prevent any scandal i am proposing  additional compensation would that be acceptable to you i want to tell you one more thing about using negoisst i am not sure if you could accept only one proposal but i would like to ask you to not do it like this i made this proposal based on future cooperation and also in some issues i took the worst option for me to generate a good deal for both of us\\xa0 so overall this agreement could be acceptable for my company but please do not accept only one proposal for one issue i do not know if that is even possible here in negoisst but to clarify this i am looking forward to reading from you best regards sasa novak \\xa0 ps after this negotiation is over i would like to know with whom i negotiated if that is also your wish i would like to share my data with you after we reach an agreement [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]hi sasa thanks for your email and therewith for taking the initiative to come up with a first offer i share your thoughts about trying to finish the negotiation before the final deadline and as well as your thoughts on trying to reach the highest utility for the both of us as you may have been informed about in the negotiation course your management took which was an idea of our hr department we need to try to reach an outcome in which the utility is  for the both of us this is obviously possible because our needs are not directly mirrored\\xa0 to gain insight in this our rd department found a tool which uses an algorythm to visualize our needs and how important they weigh to our total utility this tool however doesnt show your utility with all possible negotiation outcomes only ours the only thing there is left to do is share each others utility with all negotiation possibilities i will give you mine and i will explain you how to do this  for every point we need to negotiate on select the one that is most suitable for you so that your utility will say \\xa0  then start selecting each possible outcome for hurm directors on board and write down the percentages of utility for every of the possible options  change hurm directors on board to the option that is most beneficial for you again which must be alternate if im not mistaken and repeat the process for the other negotiation points  dont forget to select the option that is most beneficial for you again after you are going to write down the utilities of the next negotiation point otherwise the decrease of utility of multiple points will count towards your utility and you wont be able to see which negotiation point is resbonsible for which part of the decreased utility \\xa0 my utility values hurm directors                engineers in slovenia    add    add    add    payment common workers svn tech   halfhalf   hurm ag   add compensation of slovenian workers             court of jurisdiction swiss  ind arb  slovenia  \\xa0 so how are we going to apply this well in short all negotiation points that decrease drastically in utility for every stap are important for me if your utility for court of jurisdiction for example decreases less drastically than my percentages this means we will need to find an outcome that is more beneficial for me so that you give in a little and i win big we will do the same for the negotiation points that are important for you if payment common workers for example decreases more drastically for you i will need to give in here a little so you can win big\\xa0 \\xa0 fk the traditional system right this is the future \\xa0 thanks for your cooperation sasa talk later kind regards finn mendel \\xa0 [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]hi finn we have to communicate a lot that both of us will know what is best for our\\xa0companies\\xa0 you can imagine that those points are also essential for us\\xa0 \\xa0 i still think that we should leave the court in slovenia and common workers should be paid by you if you could accept this i can offer you  additional compensation which is not my best option and here i am willing to show that our company is prepared to cooperate\\xa0\\xa0 in that case i would take you two critical things court location and payment of common workers\\xa0 which is very important to you\\xa0 if you are prepared to accept that i can offer you  months for engineers in slovenia and  members on the board in that case you would have a majority in the board\\xa0 \\xa0 i am looking\\xa0forward to reading from you\\xa0 all the best sasa novak [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]hi sasa thanks for being so cooperative in this negotiation if we go on like this we will definitely come to an agreement there’s a couple of things i conclude from your email payment of common workers and court of jurisdiction is very important for the both of us so we probably will need to compromise on these parts additional payment of slovenian workers is very important for us and you showing us that you are willing to give in on this negotiation point motivates us to come towards you on a negotiation point that is important for you could you let me know which three negotiation points are relatively seen mist important for you just like i did in my last email this way we can see on which negotiation point we could best give in to you for now i propose a compromise on payment of common workers but the jursidiction is highly preferred to be in swiss thanks sasa [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]hi finn as i said my most important issue is additional compensation second is a position of a court and third is payment of common workers\\xa0 so that is the reason that i am willing to give you my most important\\xa0issue if you could give me my second and third\\xa0 what do you think about that offer is it acceptable for you\\xa0 \\xa0 kindest regards sasa [SEP]',\n",
       " '[CLS]hi sasa while considering the topics that are most important for your company i came to the following changes in my proposal i will get this hurm directors in board  from  to  \\xa0 this is what you get in return engineers in slovenia from additional  to additional  payment of common workers from halfhalf to hurm ag \\xa0 weirdly enough this offer suits me better than my previous offer even though i have the feeling that i take your wishes into account even more does this offer suit you better than my previous offer as well so not compared to your previous offer but mine from the last email slowly getting there i am curious \\xa0 i guess i gain relatively more from having more hurm directors in the board and you might gain relatively more from engineers in slovenia\\xa0 \\xa0 looking forward to what you think of this proposal sasa [SEP]',\n",
